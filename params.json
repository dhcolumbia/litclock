{"name":"Litclock","tagline":"","body":"### The clock will start tweeting at midnight on Thursday, 3/13/14.\r\nThis project was inspired by Christian Marclay's \"[The Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_(2010_film)).\" Each minute, the LIT CLOCK [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LITclock) will tweet one minute in time from a novel or narrative non-fiction book. (Occasionally, a travel guide chimes in.) Each tweet will be a quote from a book, describing what is happening in that very minute. \r\n\r\nFor example, the clock will start with a quote from [Christopher Marlowe](http://books.google.com/books/about/Dr_Faustus.html?id=g3Wy89haCCgC), at precisely 12:00 am on 3/13/14:\r\n\r\n> The clock striketh twelve O it strikes, it strikes! Now body, turn to air\r\n\r\nand then thirteen hours and nine minutes later, the LIT CLOCK will tell us that Miriam Wu from [Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy](http://books.google.com/books?id=UvK1Slvkz3MC&dq) is being interviewed:  \r\n\r\n> \"The time is 1:09 pm.” She turned off tape recorder. \r\n\r\nOur goal was to create, as [Zadie Smith said](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/apr/28/killing-orson-welles-midnight/?pagination=false) of Marclay's clock, \"thousands of fictional interpretations of time repurposed to express time precisely...\" The effect, she said, was that \"you don’t feel that you are watching a film, you feel you are existing alongside a film.\" \r\n\r\nWe hope that you'll enjoy existing alongside the nearly 1,000 books that we pulled quotes from. \r\n\r\n### How did you find time stamps in books?\r\n\r\nWe created \"[Human Intelligence Tasks](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome?variant=worker)\" (HITs) on Amazon's [Mechanical Turks](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/) website. For every minute of the day, we created one HIT, the task being to search [Google Books](http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search) for that minute in books. \r\n\r\nThis is the layout design we used to create the HITs: [create-turk-hit.txt](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/mturk/create-turk-hit.txt) and this is the input that created 1,590 HITs: [input-time-turk-hit.csv](input-time-turk-hit.csv). You can find the output of our HIT batches [here](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/tree/master/mturk).","google":"UA-30878964-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
