{"name":"Litclock","tagline":"","body":"### The clock will start tweeting at midnight on Thursday, 3/13/14.\r\nThis project was inspired by Christian Marclay's \"[The Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_(2010_film)).\" Each minute, the LIT CLOCK [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LITclock) will tweet one minute in time from a novel or narrative non-fiction book. (Occasionally, a travel guide chimes in.) Each tweet will be a quote from a book, describing what is happening in that very minute. \r\n\r\nFor example, the clock will start with a quote from [Mrs. Dalloway](http://books.google.com/books/about/Mrs_Dalloway.html?id=8AvXUpD9DiQC), at precisely 12:00 pm on 3/13/14:\r\n\r\n> It was precisely twelve o’clock; twelve by Big Ben\r\n\r\nand then an hour and nine minutes later, the LIT CLOCK will tell us that Miriam Wu from [Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy](http://books.google.com/books?id=UvK1Slvkz3MC&dq) is being interviewed:  \r\n\r\n> \"The time is 1:09 pm.” She turned off tape recorder. \r\n\r\nOur goal was to create, as [Zadie Smith said](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/apr/28/killing-orson-welles-midnight/?pagination=false) of Marclay's clock, \"thousands of fictional interpretations of time repurposed to express time precisely,\" The effect, she said, was that \"you don’t feel that you are watching a film, you feel you are existing alongside a film.\" \r\n\r\nWe hope that you'll exist alongside the nearly 1,000 books that we pulled quotes from. \r\n\r\n### How did you find the quotes?\r\n\r\nSummary paragraph about mechanical turks\r\n\r\n### How did you program the clock on Twitter?\r\n\r\nSummary paragraph about Twitter code\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
