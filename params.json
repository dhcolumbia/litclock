{"name":"Litclock","tagline":"Created by Dennis Yi Tenen and Susana Zialcita","body":"### The clock will start tweeting at midnight on Thursday, 3/13/14.\r\nThis project was inspired by Christian Marclay's \"[The Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_(2010_film)).\" Each minute, the LITclock [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LITclock) will tweet one minute in time from a novel or narrative non-fiction book. (Occasionally, a travel guide chimes in.) Each tweet will be a quote from a book, describing what is happening in that very minute. \r\n\r\nFor example, the LIT CLOCK started with a quote from [Christopher Marlowe](http://books.google.com/books/about/Dr_Faustus.html?id=g3Wy89haCCgC), at precisely 12:00 am on 3/13/14:\r\n\r\n> The clock striketh twelve O it strikes, it strikes! Now body, turn to air\r\n\r\nand then thirteen hours and nine minutes later, the LIT CLOCK told us that Miriam Wu from [Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy](http://books.google.com/books?id=UvK1Slvkz3MC&dq) is being interviewed:  \r\n\r\n> \"The time is 1:09 pm.” She turned off tape recorder. \r\n\r\nOur goal was to create, as [Zadie Smith said](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/apr/28/killing-orson-welles-midnight/?pagination=false) of Marclay's clock, \"thousands of fictional interpretations of time repurposed to express time precisely...\" The effect, she said, was that \"you don’t feel that you are watching a film, you feel you are existing alongside a film.\" \r\n\r\nWe hope that you'll enjoy existing alongside the nearly 1,000 books that we pulled quotes from. \r\n\r\n### How did you find time stamps in books?\r\n\r\nWe created \"[Human Intelligence Tasks](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome?variant=worker)\" (HITs) on Amazon's [Mechanical Turks](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/) website. For every minute of the day, we created one HIT, the task being to search [Google Books](http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search) for that minute in books. \r\n\r\nThis is the layout design we used to create the HITs: [create-turk-hit.txt](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/mturk/create-turk-hit.txt). This is the input that created HITs: [input-time-turk-hit.csv](input-time-turk-hit.csv). You can find the output of our HIT batches [here](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/tree/master/mturk).\r\n\r\n### How did you get the quotes to Tweet every minute?\r\n\r\n[This program](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/bot.py) does the following things:\r\n1. First it reads the 1,440 tweets from [this file](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/tweets.csv)\r\n2. Then it separates each line into two columns, one for the time, the other for the tweet\r\n3. Then it checks the time on our server's clock. \r\n4. If the current time matches a time found in the time column of tweets.csv, it passes the tweet to this [second program](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/cron-bot.py).\r\n ","google":"UA-30878964-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
